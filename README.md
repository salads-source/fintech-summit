# Repo guide
1. Next.js automatically maps the files within the src/app/ directory to routes in the application. Each directory within app/ corresponds to a URL path, and each page.tsx file within those directories serves as the content for that route. 

eg The page.tsx file located in /src/app/about/ would load when you visit /about in the browser.

2. Components for each page are in src/app/components/(page)
